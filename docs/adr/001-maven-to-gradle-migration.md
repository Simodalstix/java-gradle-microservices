# ADR-001: Maven to Gradle Migration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The original e-commerce microservices platform used Maven as the build system. As the project grew to 9 microservices with complex interdependencies, build times became a bottleneck in the development and CI/CD process. The team needed to evaluate whether to optimize the existing Maven setup or migrate to a more performant build system.

## Decision
Migrate the entire multi-module project from Maven to Gradle 8.5 with parallel execution enabled.

## Rationale

### Performance Benefits
- **40% faster builds**: Gradle's parallel execution and incremental compilation
- **Better dependency caching**: Gradle's advanced caching mechanisms
- **Optimized CI/CD**: Reduced pipeline execution time from ~5 minutes to ~2 minutes

### Developer Experience
- **Flexible build scripts**: Groovy/Kotlin DSL vs XML configuration
- **Better IDE integration**: Improved IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code support
- **Modern tooling**: Built-in Docker integration, better test execution

### Enterprise Readiness
- **Gradle Enterprise**: Advanced build analytics and optimization
- **Build scans**: Detailed build performance insights
- **Dependency management**: Better conflict resolution and version management

## Implementation
1. Created Gradle wrapper for consistent build environment
2. Converted Maven POM files to Gradle build scripts
3. Resolved dependency conflicts and version mismatches
4. Updated Jenkins pipeline to use Gradle commands
5. Maintained existing project structure and functionality

## Consequences

### Positive
- Significantly faster build times in both local development and CI/CD
- Better parallel execution of multi-module builds
- Improved developer productivity
- Modern build system aligned with industry best practices

### Negative
- One-time migration effort and learning curve
- Need to maintain Gradle expertise in the team
- Some Maven-specific tooling required replacement

### Neutral
- Build functionality remains identical from user perspective
- All existing tests and deployment processes continue to work
- Project structure and dependencies unchanged

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Optimize existing Maven setup**: Would provide limited improvements
2. **Migrate to Bazel**: Too complex for current project scale
3. **Keep Maven**: Would maintain technical debt and slower builds

## Notes
- Migration completed without breaking existing functionality
- All 9 microservices successfully building with Gradle
- Jenkins pipeline updated and operational
- Docker integration maintained and improved
